Purge
=====
Imagine the Purge in minecraft, this plugin does just that. Allow players to create groups,
claim land so that others cant touch it and disable PvP. However once the Purge happens all
protections are dropped for 24 hours. During the Purge players can modify claimed land, open
claimed land chests, and PvP other players.
